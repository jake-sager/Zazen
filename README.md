# Zazen

"The meaning and method of zazen varies from school to school, but in general it is a quiet type of Buddhist meditation..." -- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazen)

The old meditation app I was using got super bloated. 

**Zazen** is simple: just a timer, intervals, and stats.
No ads. No upsells. Free. Simple.
